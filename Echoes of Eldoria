Project Title: Echoes of Eldoria: A Text-Based Adventure
● Project Summary: Develop an interactive, story-driven adventure game where player
choices significantly impact the narrative and outcome. The game will primarily be textbased with static background images to enhance immersion, focusing on branching
storylines and character development.
● Description: Echoes of Eldoria will immerse players in a rich fantasy world through
descriptive text and occasional static visuals. Players will make decisions that influence
the plot, character relationships, and ultimately, the ending. The project emphasizes
narrative design, choice-based mechanics, and basic inventory management.
● Problem Statement: Many games prioritize graphics over narrative depth, leading to
less engaging storytelling experiences. There's a demand for games that offer rich,
branching narratives where player agency truly matters, providing a unique and
replayable experience.
● Proposed Solution: Create a text-based adventure game with a robust branching
narrative system. The game will use a simple interface to present choices and display
outcomes, allowing players to explore different story paths and experience varied
endings.
● Project Objectives:
○ To design a compelling story with multiple branching paths and endings.
○ To implement a choice-based narrative system.
○ To develop a basic inventory and character stat management system.
○ To integrate static background images to enhance atmosphere.
○ To ensure all narrative paths are logically consistent and bug-free.
● Scope of the Project: Development of a single-player text-based adventure game with
at least three major branching points and two distinct endings. Includes basic inventory,
character stats (e.g., health, reputation), and a save/load system.
● Out-of-Scope: Complex combat system, real-time graphics, voice acting, dynamic
character models, or online multiplayer.
● System Architecture:
○ Frontend: Web-based (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) or a simple desktop application
(e.g., Python with Tkinter/PyQt) for displaying text and images, and handling user
input.
○ Story Data: Stored in JSON, XML, or a simple text file for easy modification and
expansion.
● Modules:
○ Narrative Engine: Manages story progression, displays text, and presents
choices.
○ Choice Handler: Processes player decisions and updates game state.
○ Inventory System: Manages items collected by the player.
○ Character Stat System: Tracks and updates player attributes.
○ Save/Load System: Allows players to save and resume their game.
○ UI/Display Module: Renders text, images, and interactive elements.
● Functional Requirements:
○ The game must present narrative text and player choices.
○ Player choices must influence the story progression.
○ The game must have a functional inventory system.
○ Character stats must update based on in-game events.
○ Players must be able to save and load their game progress.
● Non-Functional Requirements:
○ Usability: Easy to read text and clear choice presentation.
○ Reliability: No broken narrative paths or crashes.
○ Maintainability: Story content should be easily editable and expandable.
○ Performance: Fast loading of text and images.
● Testing Plan:
○ Path Testing: Test all possible narrative branches and endings.
○ Choice Validation: Ensure choices lead to correct outcomes.
○ Save/Load Testing: Verify game state is correctly saved and loaded.
○ Text Review: Proofread all in-game text for grammatical errors and consistency.
● Project Deliverables:
○ Playable game application.
○ Source code.
○ Project report.
○ Game design document (including narrative flowcharts).
● Skills Tested: Narrative Design, Programming (Python, JavaScript), UI/UX Design,
Logic and Flow Control, Data Structures (for story management), Testing.
● Future Enhancements: More complex puzzles, dynamic character interactions, sound
effects, music, more detailed graphics, integration with AI for dynamic narrative
generation.
